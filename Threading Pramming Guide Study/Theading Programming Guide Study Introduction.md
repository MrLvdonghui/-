## introduction
> Important: If you are developing a new application, you are encouraged to investigate the alternative OS X technologies for implementing concurrency. This is especially true if you are not already familiar with the design techniques needed to implement a threaded application. These alternative technologies simplify the amount of work you have to do to implement concurrent paths of execution and offer much better performance than traditional threads. For information about these technologies, see Concurrency Programming Guide.

This document provides only a light coverage of the use of the POSIX threads API. For more information about the available POSIX thread routines, see the pthread man page. For a more in-depth explanation of POSIX threads and their usage, see Programming with POSIX Threads by David R. Butenhof.
